# regexctl
A tool similar to a basilar regexer but for linux consoles

## Building
This project uses cmake to increase compatibility, to build just execute `cmake .` and then `make`,
the Executable regexctl should then be in the project directory.

## Controls
There are two modes:
- Regex mode: where you edit the regex
- Text mode: where you edit the text to be matched

You can go to the regex mode with F1 and to text mode with F2
